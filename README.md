# Group14 â€“ CO2 NetZero Trackers

This project analyzes global COâ‚‚ emissions with the aim of evaluating progress toward net-zero targets by 2075. It focuses on countries with significant or growing emissions footprints to understand historical trends, forecast future developments, and assess what actions are necessary to close potential emission gaps.
